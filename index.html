                <h4>This country park on the edge of town is a great place to go on a sunny day.</h4>
                <p>There is a network of footpaths that meander around Haverhill and along a disused railway track,
                    which join onto the Stour Valley Walk. Filled with lush woodland, the park has plenty of wildlife to
                    admire, including birds, lizards, butterflies and Muntjac deer. Kids will love the massive play area
                    and recently added willow maze.</p>
